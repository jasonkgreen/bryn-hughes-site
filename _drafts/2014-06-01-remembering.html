<div>For the past few years I've complained about being unable to remember specific&nbsp;</div><div>details of my life. When did we celebrate the new year by missing the countdown waiting for our check at that terrible Italian restaurant? And what restaurant was it? Where did we go for Christmas in 2008?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I think this is common. Or I have some kind of degenerative brain disease. Hopefully the former.&nbsp;</div><br /><br />Mini golf at Masonville Mall. Driving over an entire bag of garbage.<br /><br />Trivial Pursuit winning question about Flin Flon.<br /><br />WWE-style wrestling tournament with tickets and entry fees.<br /><br /><br />
