My name is Bryn Hughes, and I teach music theory at the [Frost School of Music](http://www.miami.edu/frost/index.php/frost) at the [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu) in Coral Gables, Florida.  

My research interests include music cognition, music theory pedagogy, and popular music analysis. My dissertation involved an investigation of harmonic expectation in twelve-bar blues progressions.

I have presented my research at numerous regional, national, and international conferences. For more information, please feel free to peruse my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>.
