        <title>Another Kick At The Can</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, and welcome to yet another rendition of a blog brought to you by Bryn Hughes. I’m already cringing at the predictible opening apology that begins this and so many other restarted blogs (“No, really, this time, FOR SURE!”). I’ve tried this several times over the years; some times more successful than others; and hopefully this time it will stick. As Count Basie used to say, “let’s hear it one more, once!”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I’m a musician and a music theorist, you can expect that lots of the content here will be of the nerdy/scholarly variety. In addition, I may delve into discussions about some of my other interests, including hockey, the Toronto Maple Leafs, flipped pedagogy, open-source scholarship (including GitHub, through whom this site is hosted!), and the joy and terror surrounding my impending fatherhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned! (Do kids even know exactly what that means anymore?)&lt;/p&gt;
