  <p>This is going to be hard. </p>

<p>Having been a loyal Facebook user since 2005, I’ve decided to part ways with, or at least ignore, what has become one of my strongest and most consistent connections to my extended group of friends and family.</p>

<p>Although I cherish the countless inspiring, hilarious, and otherwise absurd interactions I’ve had on Facebook over the years, it has come to a point where it seems that I can no longer regulate my own participation in an ever-widening social web that seems to be spiraling out of control. Posts disappear, random strangers show up, and privacy settings seem to change daily. Buzzfeed, Upworthy, and other horrible memes abound. It is a constant time-suck.\</p>

<p>Blogger and Twitter provide a more straightforward stream of information with which I can interact more easily. Both are wonderfully simple platforms. I can post. I can delete posts. I can edit posts! I am in control of what it looks like, and in what order it’s presented. It’s all public, and open. </p>

<p>My last consistently updated blog existed before I had a Facebook account. Hopefully, this is a good time to start again.</p>
